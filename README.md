# frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game
This is a project for the [Udacity Frontend Nanodegree (FEND)](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001) online class.

## How to Run the game
 1. Download or clone the repository.
 2. Point your browswer to index.html

## How to Play the arcade game
The arrow keys control the player:

            (Up) :arrow_up_small:
:arrow_left_small: (Left) | (Right) :arrow_right_small:
            :arrow_down_small: (Down)

Use the arrow keys to control the movement of our Hero from space to space,
until you reach the edger of the water! If you run into a bug, you'll have to
start over :-P.
